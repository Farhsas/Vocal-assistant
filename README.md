### First Raspberry Pi project 

## Vocal assistant "Buddy"

This is the first Raspberry Pi project that I publish on Github. This project was first done for one of my classes but I decided to work on it a bit more to make it a bit better (I hope). 

The purpose of this project is to make a vocal assistant that can register a password and a PIN, but it can also register a shopping list. All of these feature are using a vocal recognition program.
But Buddy will also be capable of doing other thing such as telling the time, the weather, the date... and also turn into a flashlight. But his main feature is that he is capable of detecting falls.
